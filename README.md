Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- The motivation for this project was to grow in knowledge of coding and git a grip on the basics

- I built this project as a palpable way to learn, practice, and record my progress of course content

- This project, for others, could provide some tips for different coding languages, for me it solves my ignorance of basic coding concepts

- I learned so much! The basics of CSS, HTML, and JS, how to setup an IDE, repos through GitHub, how to navigate through the CLI, how to establish and how to utalize all of these new skills to develop code for future projects.
